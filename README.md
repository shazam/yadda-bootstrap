# yadda-bootstrap

This is a sample project showing how to use [Yadda](https://github.com/acuminous/yadda/) along with [WebDriverJS](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs) and [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/).

You can take this and use it directly in your setup by cloning the project and adding feature files and step definitions.  For a more complete guide see http://tech.shazam.com/web/bootstrapping-yadda-mocha-and-webdriverjs/
